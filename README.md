Planar Texture Alignment:
Second Life (SL) is a virtual reality "game".  I put "game" in quotes because it is much more than a game.
SL provides a creative outlet for content creators such as myself.  I build 3D homes in SL, plus
all of the components that go into that house such as doors and windows, for example.
One thing beginning (and sometimes experienced) builders have an issue with is
aligning textures applied to a surface.  This video will demonstrate just
how easy this can be.
